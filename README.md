# RAP_Database
Enhanced Version with Database Integration, Whitelisting, and Alert System
This project scans Wi-Fi networks to detect Rogue Access Points and Evil Twin attacks.
It saves all scan results and alerts to an SQLite database (wifi_scanner.db) and JSON files (scan_results.json and alert.json).
A whitelist system is also included to flag known safe networks.
